## Overview

**DeepDive** presents an automated approach for training deep search agents that can navigate complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks. Our method combines automated data synthesis from knowledge graphs with end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning to create agents capable of sophisticated long-horizon reasoning and web browsing.

### **Key Features**

- **Automated Deep Search Data Synthesis**: Generate challenging QA pairs from knowledge graphs through controlled random walks
- **Multi-Turn RL Training for Browsing**: End-to-end reinforcement learning for deep search capabilities
- **Test-Time Scaling**: Supports scaling via tool calls and parallel sampling

## **Method Overview**

### **Stage 1: Automated Data Synthesis from Knowledge Graphs**

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/kg_data_pipeline.svg" alt="Data Synthesis Pipeline" width="100%">
<p><em></em></p>
</div>

We propose an automated method to synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. The process involves three key steps:

**Knowledge Graph Random Walks**: Starting from an initial node $v_0$, we navigate through the graph for $k$ steps to form a path $P=[v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k]$, where each step $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ is a valid edge in the graph. We choose longer path lengths ($k > 5$) to increase reasoning complexity.

**Entity Obfuscation**: We combine each node $v_i$ in the path with its corresponding attributes to form an attribute-rich path:

$$P_A = [(v_0, [a_0^0, a_0^1, \ldots]), (v_1, [a_1^0, a_1^1, \ldots]), \ldots, (v_k, [a_k^0, a_k^1, \ldots])]$$

An LLM then obfuscates information along the entire path, generalizing specific details and creating "blurry entities" that require deep search to resolve.

**Difficulty Filtering**: We use a frontier model (GPT-4o) with basic search to attempt each question four times. Only questions that the frontier model fails in all attempts are retained, ensuring high difficulty.

### **Stage 2: End-to-End Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning**

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/deepdive_rl.svg" alt="Multi-Turn RL Training" width="100%">
<p><em></em></p>
</div>

We apply end-to-end multi-turn RL to enhance the agent's long-horizon reasoning and browsing capabilities. The training process follows an iterative cycle where at step $t$, the agent generates chain-of-thought $c_t$, executes browsing action $a_t$, and observes web content $o_t$.

**Multi-Turn GRPO Training**: We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization with normalized advantages:

$$
A_i = \frac{r_i - \text{mean}(\{r_k\}_{k=1}^G)}{\text{std}(\{r_k\}_{k=1}^G)}
$$

**Strict Binary Rewards**: A trajectory receives reward +1 if and only if both format correctness and answer accuracy are satisfied:

$$
r(\mathcal{T}) = \begin{cases} 1, & (\forall i, \text{Format}(c_i, a_i)) \wedge \text{Judge}(a_{\text{eos}}, a^*) \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

This strict reward mechanism ensures high-quality trajectories and prevents reward hacking.

## Data

**Synthetic Dataset Construction**

Our automated data synthesis pipeline creates challenging QA pairs through knowledge graph random walks, entity obfuscation, and difficulty filtering. The process uses multi-hop paths (k=5-9) through KILT and AMiner knowledge graphs.

**Generalization on Simple Search Tasks**

We evaluate DeepDive not only on challenging search tasks (e.g., BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH) but also on simpler benchmarks such as HotpotQA, Frames, and WebWalker.
DeepDive-32B (SFT and RL) consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving >60 points on WebWalker, surpassing WebShaper-72B (52.2).
These results demonstrate DeepDive’s strong and generalizable search capabilities.

## Test-Time Scaling

DeepDive demonstrates remarkable test-time scaling capabilities through two mechanisms:

**Tool Call Scaling**: Allowing DeepDive more tool calls during inference leads to higher accuracy on complex, multi-step tasks. As shown in the BrowseComp and BrowseComp-ZH benchmark results:

- When the maximum number of tool calls is increased, accuracy rises steadily. On BrowseComp, performance improves from 8% accuracy at 8 tool calls to 15% at 128 tool calls, showing that the model benefits from additional search and reasoning opportunities.
- DeepDive-32B consistently outperforms its SFT-only variant, especially when the allowed tool calls exceed 32. This indicates that the reinforcement learning stage better equips the model to utilize long tool call horizons.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/tool_call_scaling_combine.svg" alt="Multi-Turn RL Training" width="100%">
  <p><em> </em></p>
</div>

**Parallel Sampling**: Beyond a larger tool call budget, DeepDive leverages parallel sampling to further boost performance. For each question, DeepDive generates 8 independent reasoning trajectories in parallel.

- Three answer selection strategies are considered: single-shot inference, majority voting among samples, and choosing the answer that required the fewest tool calls before submission.
- Empirical analysis reveals a clear trend: answers submitted earlier with fewer tool calls are usually more accurate. In practice, selecting the answer with minimal tool calls among 8 samples raises accuracy from 12.0% (single-shot) to 24.8%, more than doubling performance. Majority voting also helps (18.8% accuracy), but is outperformed by minimal tool-call selection.

</div>

## Additional Study: Semi-Automated i.i.d. Deep Search QA for RL

To further boost performance on deep search tasks, we create a semi-automated framework for generating i.i.d. QA pairs.

Training with i.i.d. data brings larger improvements. The 32B-RL model reaches 22.2% accuracy on BrowseComp, up from 14.8%, and also performs better on Chinese benchmarks.
